# DumbParents

Due to the current issue of Smartparens not working with C/C#/C++ good, I decided to make my own. Its alot thinner, and does not care about any language modes, because its up to you to do the entire thing, enjoy!

Installation
-
I didn't do it propertly yet, so you just have to load the file from somewhere on the filesystem like so, from init.el: 
`(load-library "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/parens.el")`
